## 🚀 Overview

**Mars Habitat Designer** is an interactive web-based tool built for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025** under the category:

> _Your Home in Space: The Habitat Layout Creator_

The project enables users to **map, design, and visualize** a complete Mars habitat — from selecting ideal landing coordinates to customizing both exterior structures and interior layouts. It transforms complex space engineering into an intuitive, visual experience powered by **Lovable AI**, which vibe-coded the platform to feel futuristic, cohesive, and deeply user-friendly.

## 🛰️ What It Does

Users can:

1. **Map landing sites** on the Martian surface to identify ideal coordinates and terrain for their habitat.
2. **Design the habitat exterior** with adjustable shapes, volumes, and materials.
3. **Arrange the interior layout**, assigning key functional zones such as sleep, hygiene, recreation, and life support.
4. View a **fully rendered 3D model** of the final habitat, reflecting all design choices made across stages.

The **Learn More** section expands the educational mission, featuring embedded videos, audio, and downloadable transcripts that explore the real-world science and creativity behind space architecture.
